# Travel Itinerary Gap Filler

A Python system that automatically identifies and fills gaps in personal travel itineraries by parsing email data using AI-powered extraction.

## How It Works

### The Algorithm

The system uses a sophisticated multi-stage algorithm to identify and fill travel gaps:

#### 1. **Chronological Data Preparation**

- Loads existing travel data from CSV files
- Sorts all entries by departure date and time
- Validates chronological ordering to detect data inconsistencies

#### 2. **Gap Identification Engine**

The core algorithm identifies two types of geographical gaps:

- **üî¥ Country Gaps**: Critical gaps where `arrival_country != next_departure_country`
  - These represent missing international travel segments
  - Critical for visa calculations and travel documentation
  - Require immediate attention and gap-filling

- **üü° City Gaps**: Moderate gaps where `arrival_country == next_departure_country` but `arrival_city != next_departure_city`
  - These may indicate car lifts, local transportation, or short domestic travel
  - Less critical but still represent missing travel segments

#### 3. **Intelligent Email Search & Filtering Strategy**

**Email Filtering Rationale:**
The system uses a multi-stage filtering approach to efficiently process 25,000+ emails:

1. **Comprehensive Keyword Pre-filtering**:
   - Searches subject, sender, and content for 500+ travel-related keywords
   - Keywords include: airlines, hotels, transportation, destinations, travel services, documents, payments, weather, locations, and more
   - Keywords stored in `travel_keywords.txt` for easy updates
   - Reduces 25,000+ emails to ~1000 travel-related emails (96% reduction)

2. **Temporal Filtering**:
   - Searches emails up to **12 months before** travel dates to capture advance bookings
   - Includes emails from gap periods plus 7-day buffer zones
   - Captures both immediate and advance travel planning

3. **Efficient Processing**:
   - **Each email is processed by AI only once** (not per gap)
   - AI extracts all travel information from filtered emails
   - Results are then matched to specific gaps
   - Dramatically reduces API calls and processing time

#### 4. **AI-Powered Gap Filling**

- Uses OpenAI GPT-4 for intelligent travel information extraction
- **Gap-focused analysis**: Targets specific geographical connections (e.g., "Manila ‚Üí Kuala Lumpur")
- Detects various transportation methods:
  - Commercial flights and airlines
  - Car lifts and informal transportation
  - Train, bus, and other ground transport
  - Advance bookings made months before travel

#### 5. **Data Integration & Validation**

- Inserts found entries in chronological order
- Tracks source file attribution for every entry
- Validates data cohesiveness and logical flow
- Generates comprehensive gap analysis reports

### Search & Batching Strategy

The system uses an efficient multi-layered approach that processes each email only once:

#### **Rate Limiting & Context Management Solutions**

#### Problem 1: OpenAI Rate Limiting

- **Issue**: Exceeding 80,000 tokens per minute limit
- **Solution**:
  - Reduced batch size from 20 to 8 emails per batch
  - Added 1-second delays between batches
  - Implemented exponential backoff retry logic (2^attempt + jitter)
  - Switched to GPT-4o for better rate limit handling

#### Problem 2: Context Length Exceeded

- **Issue**: Prompts exceeding 8,192 token context limit
- **Solution**:
  - Reduced email content from 2,000 to 800 characters per email
  - Reduced max_tokens from 2,000 to 1,500
  - Smaller batch sizes prevent context overflow
  - Optimized prompt structure

#### **AI Model Selection Research**

**Model Comparison for Email Analysis:**

| Model | Context Length | TPM Limit | Cost/1K Tokens | Best For |
|-------|----------------|-----------|----------------|----------|
| **GPT-4o** | 128k | 200k | $0.005/$0.015 | ‚úÖ **Recommended** - Best balance |
| GPT-4 | 8k | 80k | $0.03/$0.06 | ‚ùå Too expensive, limited context |
| GPT-3.5-turbo | 16k | 200k | $0.0015/$0.002 | ‚ö†Ô∏è Less accurate for complex extraction |

**Why GPT-4o is Optimal:**

- **128k context length** handles large email batches without overflow
- **200k TPM rate limit** vs 80k for GPT-4 (2.5x higher)
- **50% lower cost** than GPT-4 ($0.005 vs $0.03)
- **Superior accuracy** for structured data extraction vs GPT-3.5-turbo
- **Better handling** of complex travel itinerary parsing

**Performance Impact:**

- Context length issues: **Eliminated** (128k vs 8k limit)
- Rate limiting: **Reduced by 60%** (200k vs 80k TPM)
- Cost efficiency: **50% reduction** in API costs
- Processing speed: **Maintained** with better error handling

#### 1. **Comprehensive Keyword Pre-filtering (96% Reduction)**
